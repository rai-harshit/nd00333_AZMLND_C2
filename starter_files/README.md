## Bank Marketing Predictor: Training, Publishing and Consumption

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we focus on 3 main steps:
  1. Creating a pipeline and training a Machine Learning model using AutoML.
  2. Publishing the pipeline and deploying the trained ML model using the Python SDK and the ML Studio.
  3. Consuning the deployed model by sending sample JSON data using Python SDK.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
The screencast of the project is available at the following URL: https://youtu.be/5Pi0KHkiBSo

The points covered in the screencast are:
  1. Working deployed ML model endpoint.
  2. Deployed Pipeline
  3. Available AutoML Model
  4. Successful API requests to the endpoint with a JSON payload
